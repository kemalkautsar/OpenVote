# OpenVote
A blockchain based voting system

## Abstract
Transparency, Freedom, and Accountability are undoubtedly pillars of democracy, which is the foundation of modern society built. We live in an Industry 4.0 era where Artificial Intellegence(AI) sits on the horizon getting ready to rise, an enterpreneur in Sekaroh, West Nusa Tenggara can talk face to face about the latest design revision with their designer on Birmingham, Alabama without geographical broundaries that prevents our forefathers to do so.

Tragically, we elect our leader the way human did many hundred years before. We cast our vote with an inherent risk of tampering, be it from the outside of system or from the tyrannical government that helds the voting. This needs to change, IMMEDIATELY.

I envision OpenVote as a system where people can cast their vote without fear of being prejudiced or persecuted because of their vote, a system where people can vote without their vote being tampered and corrupted from the outside or from the tyrannical government that held the voting, so full transparency is an occuring theme for OpenVote. The inspiration that originates this project is from CoinBundle's article from Medium (https://medium.com/coinbundle/using-blockchain-for-voting-3287817291dc). They also said an inherent accountability that comes from blockchain technology, which is decentralization ("there is no central agency which must be trusted to conduct the elections fairly and securely").

## Critique
As an engineer, I believe a good engineer is the one who knows their system's potential point of failure. OpenVote has some requirements that needs to be done or else it wil be as vapid or helpful as creating a hello world program.

First is the need for a solid citizenship ID and a way to deliver a private key for the Citizenship ID holder themself without 3rd party help. My initial idea is the ID holder will register their phone/email to the system and the private key will be sent to their phone/email, but that has a risk of "man in the middle" intrusion. The second is the ID holder will come to some sort of government office/Post Office where they entry their ID number and a printer will print out their private key in a form of QR code (akin to Indonesian train tckets system work).

The second is it all depends on the government's good will that makes the source code open, that way I choose to use GNU GPL license for the project.

## Call for contributors & Critics
I am only human, i can't do this alone. I need more people from the blockchain development community and civil society with a concern to freedom and democracy to build this idea, I hope at least this system can be used for a small voting. But our vision is greater than that, our vision is this project or the project that replaces it will be the new standard for democracy index.
